<p>This was about undestanding nested arrays how to acsess them how to chenge the picture based on a sertain event and also making the packman trun around after tuching the edge of the screen.</p>
<p>Roadmap: With pacman, there is mutch that can be done here. I would like to farther impruve by making small balls that it eats and gives a score. Maybe make it controlable by mouse and get to adding an object that is not eatable. With time it will be pussible to make this into a unique packman</p>
